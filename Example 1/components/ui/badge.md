# Badge Component Documentation

## Overview
This code file defines a `Badge` component that is used to display small, contextual labels or indicators in a user interface. The component supports various styling variants and can be easily integrated into React applications.

## Dependencies
- `class-variance-authority`: A library for managing class variants in React components.
- `React`: The core library for building user interfaces.

## Class/Module Documentation

### Badge Component
The `Badge` component is designed to render a styled badge element with customizable variants. It is part of a larger UI component library that aims to provide reusable and consistent design elements.

#### Key Functionalities
- Supports multiple styling variants (default, secondary, destructive, outline).
- Accepts additional HTML attributes for flexibility in usage.

## Function/Method Documentation

### Badge
```javascript
function Badge({ className, variant, ...props }: BadgeProps)
```
#### Summary
Renders a badge element with the specified variant and additional properties.

#### Parameters
- `className` (string, optional): Additional CSS classes to apply to the badge.
- `variant` (string, optional): The styling variant of the badge. Possible values include:
  - `default`: The default styling.
  - `secondary`: A secondary styling variant.
  - `destructive`: A variant indicating a destructive action.
  - `outline`: An outline variant.
- `...props` (HTMLDivElement attributes): Any additional attributes to be applied to the badge element.

#### Return Value
- Returns a `div` element styled as a badge.

#### Exceptions
- No specific exceptions are raised, but invalid variant values may result in unexpected styling.

## Code Block Comments
The `badgeVariants` constant uses the `cva` function to define the styling variants for the badge. Each variant is associated with specific CSS classes that dictate its appearance.

## Usage Example
```javascript
<Badge variant="secondary" className="my-custom-class">
  New
</Badge>
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- Assumes that the `variant` prop will always be one of the defined variants. If an invalid variant is provided, the default variant will be applied.
- The component is designed to handle any additional HTML attributes passed through `...props`, ensuring flexibility in usage.

## End-user Documentation
The `Badge` component can be used in any React application to display contextual labels. It is customizable through props, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their UI designs.
