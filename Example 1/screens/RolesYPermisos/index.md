## Class Documentation

### RolesYPermisos

The `RolesYPermisos` class is designed to handle the assignment and management of user roles and their associated permissions. It plays a crucial role in the security and access control of the system.

#### Key Functionalities
- Assign roles to users.
- Define permissions associated with each role.
- Check if a user has a specific permission.

## Usage Example

```javascript
import { RolesYPermisos } from './RolesYPermisos';

const rolesManager = new RolesYPermisos();
rolesManager.assignRole(userId, 'admin');
const hasAccess = rolesManager.checkPermission(userId, 'edit_content');
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- It is assumed that user IDs are always valid and exist within the system.
- The code does not handle cases where a user may have multiple roles; the behavior in such scenarios should be defined in the implementation of the class.
