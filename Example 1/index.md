# Roles and Permissions Application

This code file is responsible for rendering the main application component, `RolesYPermisos`, within a React application. It sets up the application in strict mode to help identify potential problems in the application.

## Dependencies
- React
- ReactDOM

## Main Component Documentation

### `RolesYPermisos`
The `RolesYPermisos` component is the primary component of this application. It is responsible for managing and displaying roles and permissions within the system.

#### Key Functionalities
- Displays a user interface for managing roles and permissions.
- Interacts with backend services to fetch and update role and permission data.

## Usage Example
To use this application, ensure that you have a valid HTML element with the ID `app` in your index.html file. The application can be started by running the following code:

```javascript
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { RolesYPermisos } from "./screens/RolesYPermisos";

createRoot(document.getElementById("app") as HTMLElement).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RolesYPermisos />
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- The code assumes that the HTML element with the ID `app` exists in the DOM.
- The application may not handle cases where the `RolesYPermisos` component fails to load due to network issues or other errors. Proper error handling should be implemented in the `RolesYPermisos` component.
