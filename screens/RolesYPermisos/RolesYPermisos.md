## Component Documentation

### RolesYPermisos

The `RolesYPermisos` component is responsible for rendering the main layout that includes a navigation sidebar and a user list section. It is part of a larger system for managing user roles and permissions.

#### Key Functionalities
- Renders a navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
- Displays a list of users in the main content area.

### Usage Example

```jsx
import { RolesYPermisos } from './path/to/RolesYPermisos';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RolesYPermisos />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Code Block Comments

```jsx
{/* Navigation sidebar */}
<aside className="bg-neutral-025">
  <NavigationMenuSection />
</aside>
{/* Main content area */}
<main className="flex-1">
  <UserListSection />
</main>
```

These comments clarify the structure of the layout, indicating which part of the UI is the navigation sidebar and which part is the main content area.

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- It is assumed that the `NavigationMenuSection` and `UserListSection` components are correctly implemented and handle their own internal logic.
- The layout is designed to be responsive, but specific edge cases related to screen size or user permissions are not handled within this component.
