# User List Section

This code file defines a React component that displays a list of users in a table format. It includes functionalities for user management, such as editing and deleting users, as well as options to download user lists and create new users.

## Dependencies
- `lucide-react`: For icons used in the user interface.
- `React`: The core library for building user interfaces.
- Custom UI components: `Badge`, `Button`, `Table`, `TableBody`, `TableCell`, `TableHead`, `TableHeader`, `TableRow` from the project's UI library.

## UserListSection Component

The `UserListSection` component is responsible for rendering a section that displays user data in a structured table format. It serves as a part of a larger user management system.

### Key Functionalities
- Displays a list of users with their details including name, last names, role, email, and status.
- Provides buttons for downloading user lists and creating new users.
- Allows editing and deleting of users through action buttons.

### Usage
```jsx
<UserListSection />
```

## User Data Structure

The user data is represented as an array of objects, where each object contains the following properties:
- `id` (number): Unique identifier for the user.
- `nombre` (string): User's first name.
- `apellidoPaterno` (string): User's paternal last name.
- `apellidoMaterno` (string): User's maternal last name.
- `rol` (string): User's role within the system.
- `email` (string): User's email address.
- `habilitado` (boolean): Indicates if the user is enabled.

### Example User Data
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "nombre": "Carlos",
  "apellidoPaterno": "Marin",
  "apellidoMaterno": "Roldan",
  "rol": "Administrador",
  "email": "usuario@colegio.com",
  "habilitado": true
}
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- The code assumes that the user data will always be in the specified format.
- If the `habilitado` property is `true`, a badge indicating the user is enabled will be displayed; otherwise, it will not show any indication.
- The component does not handle cases where the user data might be empty or malformed; it is expected that valid data will be provided.

## End-user Documentation
This component is intended for use in a user management interface, allowing administrators to view, edit, and manage user accounts efficiently.
