Certainly, here is the integrated Mermaid Markdown script enclosed within code block delimiters. It represents a consolidated system overview diagram:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] --> B[Spotipy Object]
    B --> C[get_user Function]
    B --> D[adjust_volume Function]
    B --> E[play_pause Function]
    B --> F[next_song Function]
    B --> G[prev_song Function]
    C --> H[User Spotify Username]
    D --> I[Volume Adjustment]
    E --> J[Playback Status]
    F --> K[Next Song]
    G --> L[Previous Song]
```

This script will generate a flowchart diagram that starts with a user interacting with a Spotipy object, which then branches off into various functions, each leading to a different outcome.
