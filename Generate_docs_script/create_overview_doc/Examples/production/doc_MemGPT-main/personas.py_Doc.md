## Module: personas.py
- **Module Name**: The module is named "personas.py".

- **Primary Objectives**: This module's primary purpose is to retrieve persona text from a specified file. If no file path is provided, it will look for the file in the "examples" directory.

- **Critical Functions**: The main function in this module is `get_persona_text(key=DEFAULT, dir=None)`. This function fetches the content of a text file based on the provided key. If the key does not have a ".txt" extension, it appends it. If no directory is specified, the function looks for the file in the "examples" directory. If the file does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

- **Key Variables**: The critical variables in this module are `key`, `dir`, `filename`, and `file_path`. The `key` is the name of the text file, `dir` is the directory where the function looks for the file, `filename` is the full name of the file, and `file_path` is the full path to the file.

- **Interdependencies**: This module depends on the `os` module for interacting with the operating system's file system.

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: The core operation is the `get_persona_text()` function. There are no auxiliary operations in this module.

- **Operational Sequence**: The function first checks if a directory is provided. If not, it sets the directory to the "examples" folder. It then constructs the filename and the full path to the file. Finally, it tries to open the file and return its content. If the file does not exist, it raises an error.

- **Performance Aspects**: The module's performance depends on the efficiency of the file system operations. Since it involves disk I/O operations, it might be slower than in-memory operations.

- **Reusability**: The `get_persona_text()` function is highly reusable. It can be used to read any text file in any directory, making it a versatile function for file reading operations.

- **Usage**: This module is used when there is a need to fetch persona text from a file. The user can specify the file's name and optionally its directory.

- **Assumptions**: The function assumes that the file exists in the specified directory. If the file does not exist, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`. It also assumes that the file's content can be read as text.
