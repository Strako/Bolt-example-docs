## Module: test_questionary.py
- **Module Name**: The module name is `test_questionary.py`.

- **Primary Objectives**: The purpose of this module is to test the legacy CLI (Command Line Interface) sequence of the `memgpt` program.

- **Critical Functions**: The main function is `test_legacy_cli_sequence()`. This function tests the sequence of prompts and responses in the CLI of the `memgpt` program.

- **Key Variables**: `TIMEOUT` is a key variable that sets the maximum wait time for responses. `child` is another key variable representing the spawned child process.

- **Interdependencies**: This module interacts with the `memgpt` program and the `pexpect` module for spawning child processes and expecting responses.

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: The core operation of this module is to test the `memgpt` program's CLI sequence. The auxiliary operations include setting up the child process, sending lines to the CLI, expecting responses, and checking the exit status of the child process.

- **Operational Sequence**: The sequence involves spawning a child process, sending commands to the CLI, expecting responses, and finally checking the exit status of the child process.

- **Performance Aspects**: The performance of this module depends on the responsiveness of the `memgpt` program's CLI and the timeout set for responses.

- **Reusability**: This module can be reused for testing different sequences of the `memgpt` program's CLI. However, it may need modifications depending on the specific sequence to be tested.

- **Usage**: This module is used for testing purposes, specifically for validating the correct functioning of the `memgpt` program's CLI sequence.

- **Assumptions**: The module assumes that the `memgpt` program's CLI will respond within the set timeout period. It also assumes that the `memgpt` program's CLI will react as expected to the sent commands.
