## Module: gpt_summarize.py
- **Module Name**: The module is named `gpt_summarize.py`.

- **Primary Objectives**: This module's purpose is to summarize a history of previous messages in a conversation between an AI persona and a human. The summary is from the AI's perspective and must be less than a given word limit.

- **Critical Functions**: The main function of this module is to generate a summary of the conversation. However, the specific functions/methods aren't provided in the given context.

- **Key Variables**: The key variable is `WORD_LIMIT`, which determines the maximum length of the summary.

- **Interdependencies**: The module interacts with the conversation history and the AI's messages. It also relies on the system's ability to distinguish between different roles ('assistant', 'user', 'function') and events (login, heartbeat).

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: The core operation is the summarization of the conversation. Auxiliary operations could include parsing the conversation, identifying the roles and messages, and ensuring the word limit isn't exceeded.

- **Operational Sequence**: The module likely begins by parsing the conversation history, identifying the roles and messages, then generates a summary from the AI's perspective, and finally ensures the summary doesn't exceed the word limit.

- **Performance Aspects**: Performance considerations may include the efficiency of the summarization algorithm and the ability to process large conversation histories within the word limit.

- **Reusability**: This module could potentially be reused for summarizing any conversation, provided the conversation follows the same structure of roles and messages.

- **Usage**: This module is used to generate a concise summary of a conversation between an AI and a human, useful for understanding the context and content of the conversation without needing to read the entire conversation history.

- **Assumptions**: The module assumes that the AI's messages are marked with the 'assistant' role, function outputs are marked with the 'function' role, and user messages and system events are marked with the 'user' role. It also assumes that the conversation follows a certain structure and that the AI's inner monologue is not visible to the user.
