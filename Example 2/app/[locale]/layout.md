# Root Layout Component

This code file defines the `RootLayout` component for a Next.js application, which serves as the main layout for the application. It integrates internationalization support and applies global styles.

## Dependencies
- `next`: A React framework for server-rendered applications.
- `next/font/google`: For loading Google Fonts.
- `next-intl`: A library for internationalization in Next.js applications.

## Class/Module Documentation

### RootLayout
The `RootLayout` component is responsible for rendering the main structure of the application, including the HTML document and body. It integrates internationalization by fetching the current locale and messages.

#### Key Functionalities
- Fetches the current locale and messages for internationalization.
- Applies global styles and font settings.
- Wraps the application in the `NextIntlClientProvider` for internationalization support.

## Function/Method Documentation

### RootLayout
```typescript
export default async function RootLayout({ children }: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode; }>)
```
- **Summary**: Renders the main layout of the application, including internationalization support and global styles.
- **Parameters**:
  - `children` (React.ReactNode): The child components to be rendered within the layout.
- **Return Value**: Returns a JSX element representing the HTML structure of the application.
- **Exceptions**: May throw errors if the locale or messages cannot be fetched.

## Code Block Comments
```javascript
const locale = await getLocale(); // Fetches the current locale for internationalization
const messages = await getMessages(); // Fetches the messages corresponding to the current locale
```

## Usage Example
```javascript
<RootLayout>
  <YourComponent />
</RootLayout>
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- Assumes that the locale and messages can be successfully fetched from the `next-intl` library.
- The code is designed to handle scenarios where the `children` prop is empty, rendering an empty layout without errors.
