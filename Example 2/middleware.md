# Middleware Documentation

This code file sets up internationalization middleware for a Next.js application using the `next-intl` library. It facilitates routing based on the user's language preference.

## Dependencies
- `next-intl`: A library for handling internationalization in Next.js applications.

## Module Documentation

### Middleware
This module exports a middleware function created using `createMiddleware` from the `next-intl` library. It is responsible for managing language routing based on the defined routes.

#### Key Functionalities
- **Routing**: The middleware uses the routing configuration imported from `./i18n/routing` to determine how to handle requests based on the user's language.

## Code Block Comments
```javascript
// Create middleware for internationalization using the defined routing
export default createMiddleware(routing);

// Configuration for the middleware
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/", "/(es|en)/:path*"], // Define the available languages for routing
};
```

## Usage Example
To use this middleware in a Next.js application, ensure that the `next-intl` library is installed and the routing configuration is properly set up in `./i18n/routing`. The middleware can be imported and used in the Next.js application as follows:

```javascript
import middleware from './path/to/middleware';
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- The code assumes that the routing configuration in `./i18n/routing` is correctly defined and includes the necessary language routes.
- The matcher is set to handle requests for the root path and paths prefixed with either "es" or "en", which are the supported languages. If a request is made with an unsupported language, the middleware will not match, and the default behavior will apply.
