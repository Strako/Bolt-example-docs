# MessageLoading Component

This code file defines a React functional component named `MessageLoading`, which renders an animated loading spinner using SVG elements. The spinner consists of three circles that animate vertically to create a loading effect.

## Dependencies
- React: This component requires React to function as it is a functional component.

## Component Documentation

### MessageLoading
The `MessageLoading` component is designed to provide a visual indication of loading status in user interfaces. It can be used in applications where asynchronous operations are performed, such as data fetching or processing.

#### Key Functionalities
- Renders an SVG-based loading spinner.
- Utilizes CSS classes for styling (e.g., `text-foreground`).

## Function Documentation

### MessageLoading()
#### Summary
Renders an animated loading spinner using SVG circles.

#### Return Value
- **Type**: JSX Element
- **Description**: Returns an SVG element that visually represents a loading spinner.

## Code Block Comments
- The component uses three `<circle>` elements, each with an animation that changes their vertical position (`cy` attribute) to create a bouncing effect.
- The animations are synchronized using the `begin` attribute, which controls the start time of each circle's animation relative to the others.

## Usage Example
```jsx
import MessageLoading from './MessageLoading';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Loading Data...</h1>
      <MessageLoading />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- Assumes that the component will be used within a React application.
- The component does not handle any props or state, and it is expected to be used as a standalone loading indicator.
