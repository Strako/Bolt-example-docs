# Card Component Documentation

This code file defines a set of React components that represent a card UI element, including the card itself, its header, title, description, content, and footer. These components are designed to be reusable and customizable, allowing developers to create card layouts easily.

## Dependencies
- React: This code relies on the React library for building user interfaces.
- Utility functions from "@/lib/utils": The `cn` function is used for conditional class name management.

## Components

### Card
The `Card` component serves as the main container for the card UI. It provides a rounded border, background color, and shadow effect.

- **Key Methods/Attributes:**
  - `className`: Optional additional classes to apply to the card.
  
#### Example Usage
```jsx
<Card className="custom-class">Content goes here</Card>
```

### CardHeader
The `CardHeader` component is used to display the header section of the card, typically containing the title and description.

- **Key Methods/Attributes:**
  - `className`: Optional additional classes to apply to the header.

#### Example Usage
```jsx
<CardHeader className="header-class">Header Content</CardHeader>
```

### CardTitle
The `CardTitle` component is used to display the title of the card, styled prominently.

- **Key Methods/Attributes:**
  - `className`: Optional additional classes to apply to the title.

#### Example Usage
```jsx
<CardTitle className="title-class">My Card Title</CardTitle>
```

### CardDescription
The `CardDescription` component is used to provide a brief description or subtitle for the card.

- **Key Methods/Attributes:**
  - `className`: Optional additional classes to apply to the description.

#### Example Usage
```jsx
<CardDescription className="description-class">This is a description of the card.</CardDescription>
```

### CardContent
The `CardContent` component is used to display the main content of the card.

- **Key Methods/Attributes:**
  - `className`: Optional additional classes to apply to the content.

#### Example Usage
```jsx
<CardContent className="content-class">Main content goes here.</CardContent>
```

### CardFooter
The `CardFooter` component is used to display the footer section of the card, often containing action buttons or additional information.

- **Key Methods/Attributes:**
  - `className`: Optional additional classes to apply to the footer.

#### Example Usage
```jsx
<CardFooter className="footer-class">Footer Content</CardFooter>
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- The components assume that the `className` prop will be a valid string. If an invalid value is passed, it may lead to unexpected styling.
- The components are designed to be flexible and can accept any valid HTML attributes through the `...props` spread operator.

## End-user Documentation
These components can be used to create a card layout in any React application. They are designed to be easily customizable through props, allowing developers to tailor the appearance and content of the cards to fit their needs.
