# Avatar Component Documentation

This code file defines a set of React components for rendering user avatars using the Radix UI Avatar primitives. It provides a customizable and reusable avatar component structure that includes an image and a fallback option.

## Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-avatar`: A library providing accessible and customizable avatar components for React.
- `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Components

### Avatar
The `Avatar` component serves as the main wrapper for the avatar image and fallback. It is designed to be flexible and can accept additional class names for styling.

#### Key Methods and Attributes
- **Props**: Inherits all props from `AvatarPrimitive.Root`.
- **className**: Optional additional class names for custom styling.

#### Usage
```jsx
<Avatar className="custom-class" />
```

### AvatarImage
The `AvatarImage` component is used to display the user's avatar image. It ensures that the image maintains its aspect ratio and fills the available space.

#### Key Methods and Attributes
- **Props**: Inherits all props from `AvatarPrimitive.Image`.
- **className**: Optional additional class names for custom styling.

#### Usage
```jsx
<AvatarImage src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="User Avatar" className="custom-class" />
```

### AvatarFallback
The `AvatarFallback` component is displayed when the avatar image fails to load. It provides a default visual representation, typically a placeholder or initials.

#### Key Methods and Attributes
- **Props**: Inherits all props from `AvatarPrimitive.Fallback`.
- **className**: Optional additional class names for custom styling.

#### Usage
```jsx
<AvatarFallback className="custom-class">AB</AvatarFallback>
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- The code assumes that the `src` prop for `AvatarImage` will be a valid image URL. If the URL is invalid or the image fails to load, the `AvatarFallback` will be displayed.
- The components are designed to be used within a React application and may not function as intended outside of this context.
